Simple project to get started in Kaggle competition

## Overview
This is just a simple project to get myself started in Kaggle's competition. The
Titanic set is considered to be a "Hello World" project in Data Science. I
thought I would utilize a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a starting
point.
